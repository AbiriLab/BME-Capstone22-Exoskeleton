if arduino_serial_data = "in middle":
    update canvas image as left arrow
    arduino data = False
    freeze/wait until (new) arduino data = True


-- motor sends data to arduino, then arduino sends serial data to python/comp
thru USB, can have print statements showing location of platform/motor
so, can then update GUI and tell arduino what to do next(thru another serial comm?)

1. arduino sends code to python to say "at center"
2. python sends code to arduino to move left (updates GUI with left prompt), wait for new code from arduino
3. arduino sends python code "all done" (update GUI with stop prompt)
4. python sends another command: "move right" (update GUI with right arrow prompt)
5. arudino moves motor, then sends to python "all done"
6. now another python command to arduino


on start up:
send motor command to center for "calibration" and be at center sensor -- "Home" button
have gui on waiting for command

Speed options on GUIs - low, med, high

synchronized cursor with motor position for option for moving directions instead of just pictures

1 trial - center, left, center, right, center, end
